	  First thoughts: Since we are aiming to optimize for memory usage a fist 
	  thought is to use a heap like data structure, which will allow us to order
	  the input in-place. The down-side of this approach is time spent accessing 
	  median element (as we will have to pop from the top of the heap).
	  
	  Assumptions: Will (at least to begin with) assume that we know the size of 
	  each input beforehand.
